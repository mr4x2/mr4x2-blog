## Introduction

Since it's Tet Holiday (Lunar New Year in Vietnam), I have plenty of time to reflect on the most memorable moments from 2025. It’s been a long time since I’ve written anything in my blog. So let's dive into my trip to France for my second time to go abroad after [Thailand trip]({{< ref "/a-great-trip-in-Thailand/index.md" >}}).

In June 2025, I received an acceptance letter for my application to [OpenInfra Europe 2025 Submit](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/) in France which would be held in October in France.

And then, I came to my boss and was willing to represent [Viettel Cloud](https://viettelcloud.vn/en) to present my topic in this conference. After many discussions, I was accepted to travel to France. During preparing documents for my flight, my colleagues and my bosses helped me so much, and I couldn’t go to France without them.

## Hanoi to Paris

Then came the day of my long-haul flight to Paris.

After watching 3 movies and going to sleep, I finally landed on Paris. At that time, I felt a little bit of tired, but very excited. The weather was cool and much cleaner than Hanoi's 😅.

From the venue where the conference was hosted to Paris CDG airport, it took 2 hours to travel. 
I traveled there by metro. Finally, I arrived at [**École Polytechnique**](https://www.polytechnique.edu/actualites/lopeninfra-summit-europe-2025-organise-lecole-polytechnique), where the event was being held.

## OpenInfra Europe Submit

At this event, I not only presented but also received an assignment from my boss to collect news on cloud technology, particularly focusing on NVME technology.

In addition, I participated in keynote sessions and small group discussions to exchange ideas and insights about cloud infrastructure. These activities provided valuable experience for both me and our organization.

In this conference, I met Mr. Sang Tran who currently leads infrastructure in FPT Smart Cloud. He and I were the only two representatives from Vietnam's tech industry at the event. We also took a picture together.

My session was scheduled the final of the event. Although it was scheduled on the last day, many people still participated in my session.During the session, I didn't present fluently and felt a bit shy, but the audience still listened attentively and asked me some good questions. Even it wasn't my best performance, I completed my presentation and shared innovative cloud technology with the international audience.

## Nightlife in Paris and Palaiseau

Because of business trip, I didn’t have much time to travel in Palaiseau and Paris, but still had enough experience in these places.

I spent 3 nights total: 2 nights in Palaiseau and 1 night in Paris. On my first night, I fell asleep immediately due to jetlag 😂.

Let’s move to Paris. I visited the Eiffel Tower, which is absolutely the most iconic landmark in France. I took some photos and selfies.

I also walked along the Seine River, which is beautiful despite the unpleasant smell. Because of the distance from my hotel to central Paris, I decided to return early and didn't visit other attractions. I have some regrets about not visiting museums or Paris Saint-Germain's stadium.

In Palaiseau, I spent most of my time enjoying local food. The first food which I ate was burger.

The second meal was grilled beef and lamb.

On the final day, I went to a local restaurant and ordered burrata cheese with salad and fried pork, along with a Coke. To be honest, these dishes were perfect for me. However, I regret not trying more food in Paris.

## The final

After 3 days in France, I moved to Germany for traveling but this trip is not mentioned in this blog for personal reason.

My blog is coming to an end. This trip was one of the most memorable experiences of 2025. For 2026, I hope I can travel to many places and have as many wonderful experiences as I did in 2025. Finally, happy new year everyone! Cheers!
