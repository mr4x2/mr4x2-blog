## This is my first blog

After a lot of procrastinations, today I've finally decided to publish my blog. In this blog, I will share my thoughts on life, work, and some technical topics. Besides that, I also want to improve my English writing skills. I hope you all will support me in the future!


## Trip in Thailand 

This trip was our plan(<a href="https://hoangndst.com" target="_blank">@hoangndst</a> and I) which was planned in early January when <a href="https://eventyay.com/e/4c0e0c27" target="_blank">Fossasia 2025</a> was scheduled to be hosted in Thailand, at which Hoang had a session that he shared about <a href="https://eventyay.com/e/4c0e0c27/session/9434#info" target="_blank">Optimizing the Software Development Process with Internal Developer Platform and Kusion</a>. 

Another reason I want to go with Hoang to Thailand to save our nice memories before Hoang studies aboard in USA. 

### Day 1 - Khaosand rd

My flight departed at 11.00 am from Noi Bai Airport to Don Mueang Airport. From plane in the sky, I saw Bangkok from a different view compared to Hanoi, which has many canals.

After that, I took rest after a long trip from the Airport to the housetel. I was excited when I ran on the streets of Bangkok, where everything was new to me. Me and my friend were hungry, so we decided to go a nearby market (Khaosand road market) near our housetel to get some local food. Pad Thai, which is traditional food in Thailand. It is similar like to "phở xào" fried Pho in Vietnam but more sourer and spicer than.

### Day 2 - FOSSASIA

On the morning day 2, which was an important day for <a href="https://hoangndst.com" target="_blank">@hoangndst</a>, who had a session to prensent about an open-source project on Platform Development -  <a href="https://github.com/KusionStack/kusion" target="_blank">Kusion</a>. My role in this session was to support for <a href="https://hoangndst.com" target="_blank">@hoangndst</a>. Besides, it was the first time I had met <a href="https://github.com/liu-hm19" target="_blank">Liu Ming</a> from Ant Group, who is also a maintainer and contributor for Kusion. During the session, I was inspired the idea that I could stand on a stage to prensent something one day.

After a successful session, we went to Siam Square. The weather in Bangkok at that time was so hot that we took some drinks and went to Popmart to buy some toys. I bought a blind box from the Spider-Man collection. Do you know which version of Spider-Man I got? That was Miles G. Morales from Earth-42.

We went back to Khaosand Rd Market to have rice with tomyum seafood and drink cocktails.

Because of we want to explore Bangkok nightlife, we rented two bycycle and traveled around Bangkok at midnight. The city looked like classic with a golden-yellow glow from the pagodas.

It was another long day with me!

### Day 3 - Grand Palace

The Grand Palace is famous travel destination, where King and Queen live. It is traditional and has something luxurious beauty that I can't describe. Hoang took for me a picture of me in a pagoda but I can't remmember its name right now.

Like any other hot day in Thailand, I felt tired, so we decided to go back to the housetel and take a rest.

On last night in Bangkok, I went to BigC and bought some souvenirs and gifts, which was traditional cakes and candies in Thailand, for my family.

### Conclusion

The trip in Thailand was fun and i've had a new experience in traveling. In future, I hope I can discovery many new places and cultures. As the Vietnamese saying goes, "Spring is the season of new beginnings and personal growth". Just like that, I want to make new memories, learn new things, and explore new places while I’m still young.
